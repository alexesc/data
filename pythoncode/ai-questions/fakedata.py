# you can create a function in Python that generates fake data for Y based on a given range, for example 10 percent up or down from the original Y data. Here's one way to do it:

import numpy as np

def generate_fake_data(X, Y, range_percent):
    # Calculate the range for the fake data
    range_value = Y * (range_percent / 100)
    
    # Generate fake data that moves smoothly from up to down or vice versa
    fake_data = Y + np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, len(X))) * range_value
    
    return fake_data

# This function generates fake data for Y by using the np.sin function to generate values that smoothly oscillate between positive and negative values. The range of the fake data is set by range_percent, which is a percentage of the original Y values.

#The smoothness and speed of the oscillation between the positive and negative values of the fake data can be controlled by changing the np.linspace argument in the np.sin function.

#The argument np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, len(X)) generates an array of values that ranges from 0 to 10 * np.pi with len(X) number of elements. The 10 in 10 * np.pi controls the number of cycles that the oscillation goes through in the given range, so increasing this value will make the oscillation faster, and decreasing it will make it slower.

#For example, to make the oscillation slower, you could change 10 * np.pi to 5 * np.pi, like this:

fake_data = Y + np.sin(np.linspace(0, 5 * np.pi, len(X))) * range_value

# And to make it faster, you could change it to 20 * np.pi, like this:

fake_data = Y + np.sin(np.linspace(0, 20 * np.pi, len(X))) * range_value

# The np.pi argument in the np.sin function controls the amplitude of the oscillation, so increasing it will make the oscillation larger, and decreasing it will make it smaller.

# there are other functions that you could use to generate fake data for Y. For example, you could use the np.cos function or the np.tan function to generate different fake data:

fake_data = Y + np.cos(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, len(X))) * range_value

fake_data = Y + np.tan(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, len(X))) * range_value

# You can also use the np.random.normal function to generate fake data that is normally distributed around the original Y values:

fake_data = Y + np.random.normal(0, range_value, len(X))

# The first argument in the np.random.normal function is the mean of the normal distribution, and the second argument is the standard deviation of the normal distribution. The third argument is the number of elements in the array that is generated.

# The np.random.normal function can be used to generate fake data that is normally distributed around the original Y values, but it can also be used to generate fake data that is normally distributed around any value. For example, to generate fake data that is normally distributed around 100, you could use this:

fake_data = np.random.normal(100, range_value, len(X))

# You could also use a combination of functions, such as np.sin and np.cos:

fake_data = Y + np.sin(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, len(X))) * range_value * np.cos(np.linspace(0, 10 * np.pi, len(X)))

# The fake data that is generated by the generate_fake_data function is used to create a new column in the DataFrame that contains the fake data. The new column is named "Fake Data", and it is added to the DataFrame after the original Y data:

# Path: data.py
# Add fake data to the DataFrame
df['Fake Data'] = generate_fake_data(df['X'], df['Y'], 10)

# The generate_fake_data function is called with the X and Y columns of the DataFrame as arguments, and the range_percent argument is set to 10. This means that the fake data will be generated with a range of 10 percent of the original Y values.

# The fake data is added to the DataFrame as a new column named "Fake Data".

# The fake data is then used to create a new column in the DataFrame that contains the difference between the fake data and the original Y data:

# Path: data.py
# Add the difference between the fake data and the original Y data to the DataFrame

df['Difference'] = df['Fake Data'] - df['Y']

# The difference between the fake data and the original Y data is added to the DataFrame as a new column named "Difference".

# The fake data is then used to create a new column in the DataFrame that contains the percentage difference between the fake data and the original Y data:

# Path: data.py
# Add the percentage difference between the fake data and the original Y data to the DataFrame

df['Percentage Difference'] = (df['Difference'] / df['Y']) * 100

# The percentage difference between the fake data and the original Y data is added to the DataFrame as a new column named "Percentage Difference".

# The fake data is then used to create a new column in the DataFrame that contains the absolute value of the percentage difference between the fake data and the original Y data:

# Path: data.py
# Add the absolute value of the percentage difference between the fake data and the original Y data to the DataFrame

df['Absolute Percentage Difference'] = np.abs(df['Percentage Difference'])

# The absolute value of the percentage difference between the fake data and the original Y data is added to the DataFrame as a new column named "Absolute Percentage Difference".

# The fake data is then used to create a new column in the DataFrame that contains the absolute value of the difference between the fake data and the original Y data:

# Path: data.py
# Add the absolute value of the difference between the fake data and the original Y data to the DataFrame

df['Absolute Difference'] = np.abs(df['Difference'])

# it is possible to generate fake data Y1 and Y2 that simulate Bollinger Bands around Y. Bollinger Bands consist of a simple moving average (SMA) line in the middle and two standard deviation lines above and below the SMA.

#Here's one way to generate fake data for Y1 and Y2 that simulate Bollinger Bands around Y in Python:

import numpy as np

def generate_fake_bollinger_bands(X, Y, window, deviation):
    # Calculate the SMA
    sma = np.convolve(Y, np.ones(window)/window, mode='valid')
    
    # Calculate the standard deviation
    std_dev = np.sqrt(np.convolve(np.power(Y - sma, 2), np.ones(window)/window, mode='valid'))
    
    # Generate fake data for Y1 and Y2
    Y1 = sma - deviation * std_dev
    Y2 = sma + deviation * std_dev
    
    return Y1, Y2


# The generate_fake_bollinger_bands function takes four arguments: X, Y, window, and deviation.

# This function generates fake data for Y1 and Y2 by first calculating the SMA of the original Y data using the np.convolve function with a moving average window of size window. Then, the standard deviation is calculated using the np.sqrt function and np.convolve. Finally, Y1 is calculated as the SMA minus deviation times the standard deviation, and Y2 is calculated as the SMA plus deviation times the standard deviation.

# Note that deviation is a parameter that you can set to control the distance between the SMA and the upper and lower Bollinger Bands. The higher the value of deviation, the further apart the bands will be from the SMA.

# The logical values for the deviation parameter in the generate_fake_bollinger_bands function depend on the specific requirements of your data and analysis. Typically, deviation is set to 2 or 2.5 to represent two or 2.5 standard deviations from the SMA.

# The logical values for the window parameter depend on the length of your data and the desired smoothness of the SMA line. A commonly used window size is 20, but this may vary depending on the length of your data and the desired level of smoothing. A larger window size will result in a smoother SMA line, while a smaller window size will result in a more sensitive SMA line that reacts more quickly to changes in the data.

# For example, if you have daily data for a year (252 days), a window size of 20 would result in an SMA line that represents a 20-day moving average. If you have weekly data for 5 years (260 weeks), a window size of 20 would result in an SMA line that represents a 20-week moving average.

# It's important to note that the choice of deviation and window values should be based on the specific requirements of your data and analysis, and may require some experimentation and testing to find the best values.

# The generate_fake_bollinger_bands function is called with the X and Y columns of the DataFrame as arguments, and the window and deviation arguments are set to 20 and 2, respectively:

# Path: data.py
# Add fake data to the DataFrame
df['Y1'], df['Y2'] = generate_fake_bollinger_bands(df['X'], df['Y'], 20, 2)

# The generate_fake_bollinger_bands function is called with the X and Y columns of the DataFrame as arguments, and the window and deviation arguments are set to 20 and 2, respectively. This means that the fake data will be generated with a window size of 20 and a deviation of 2.

# The fake data is added to the DataFrame as new columns named "Y1" and "Y2".

# Now I would like to make a graph of the fake data with smooth spline curves X and Y as moving average and X, (Y1 and Y2) as bollinger band, and give a shadow to the bollinger band.

# Here's one way to make a graph of the fake data with smooth spline curves in Python:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

def plot_fake_data(X, Y, Y1, Y2):
    # Create the figure
    fig = plt.figure()
    
    # Add an axes
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    
    # Plot the data
    ax.plot(X, Y, color='black', linewidth=2, label='Moving Average')
    ax.plot(X, Y1, color='blue', linewidth=1, label='Bollinger Band')
    ax.plot(X, Y2, color='blue', linewidth=1)
    
    # Fill the area between the Bollinger Bands
    ax.fill_between(X, Y1, Y2, color='blue', alpha=0.2)
    
    # Set the title and labels
    ax.set_title('Fake Data')
    ax.set_xlabel('X')
    ax.set_ylabel('Y')
    
    # Set the legend
    ax.legend()
    
    # Show the plot
    plt.show()

# The plot_fake_data function takes four arguments: X, Y, Y1, and Y2.

# This function creates a figure and adds an axes to the figure. Then, the function plots the data as a black line with a linewidth of 2 for the moving average, and as a blue line with a linewidth of 1 for the Bollinger Bands. The function then fills the area between the Bollinger Bands with a blue color and an alpha value of 0.2 to give the Bollinger Bands a shadow effect.

# The function then sets the title and labels for the axes, and adds a legend to the plot. Finally, the function shows the plot.

# The plot_fake_data function is called with the X, Y, Y1, and Y2 columns of the DataFrame as arguments:

# Path: data.py
# Plot the fake data

plot_fake_data(df['X'], df['Y'], df['Y1'], df['Y2'])

# The plot_fake_data function is called with the X, Y, Y1, and Y2 columns of the DataFrame as arguments. This means that the fake data will be plotted with a window size of 20 and a deviation of 2.

# The plot_fake_data function is called with the X, Y, Y1, and Y2 columns of the DataFrame as arguments. This means that the fake data will be plotted with a window size of 20 and a deviation of 2.

# To create a graph of the fake data with smooth spline curves, you can use the matplotlib library in Python. Here's an example of how to plot the X and Y data as a moving average curve, and X, Y1, and Y2 as the Bollinger Bands:

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.interpolate import UnivariateSpline

# Generate the fake moving average data
X = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
Y = np.sin(X)

# Generate the fake Bollinger Band data
window = 20
deviation = 2
Y1, Y2 = generate_fake_bollinger_bands(X, Y, window, deviation)

# Plot the moving average curve
plt.plot(X, Y, 'b-', label='Moving Average')

# Plot the Bollinger Bands
plt.fill_between(X, Y1, Y2, color='gray', alpha=0.2, label='Bollinger Bands')
plt.plot(X, Y1, 'r-', label='Lower Band')
plt.plot(X, Y2, 'r-', label='Upper Band')

# Interpolate the moving average and Bollinger Band data with splines
spline = UnivariateSpline(X, Y)
spline.set_smoothing_factor(0.5)
X_smooth = np.linspace(X[0], X[-1], 1000)
Y_smooth = spline(X_smooth)

spline1 = UnivariateSpline(X, Y1)
spline1.set_smoothing_factor(0.5)
Y1_smooth = spline1(X_smooth)

spline2 = UnivariateSpline(X, Y2)
spline2.set_smoothing_factor(0.5)
Y2_smooth = spline2(X_smooth)

# Plot the spline curves
plt.plot(X_smooth, Y_smooth, 'g-', label='Moving Average (Smooth)')
plt.fill_between(X_smooth, Y1_smooth, Y2_smooth, color='gray', alpha=0.2, label='Bollinger Bands (Smooth)')
plt.plot(X_smooth, Y1_smooth, 'r-', label='Lower Band (Smooth)')
plt.plot(X_smooth, Y2_smooth, 'r-', label='Upper Band (Smooth)')

# Add a legend and labels
plt.legend()
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')

# Show the plot
plt.show()


# This code uses the UnivariateSpline class from the scipy.interpolate module to create smooth spline curves of the moving average and Bollinger Band data. The set_smoothing_factor method is used to control the level of smoothing in the spline curves, where a smaller value results in a smoother curve and a larger value results in a more jagged curve. The Bollinger Bands are filled with a gray color and given an alpha of 0.2 to give the Bollinger Bands a shadow effect. Finally, the plot is displayed using the show method from the matplotlib.pyplot module.

# This is just one way to plot the fake data with smooth spline curves. You can experiment with different values for the smoothing factor and other parameters to see how they affect the resulting graph.
